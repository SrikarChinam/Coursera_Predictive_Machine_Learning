# Background
# 
# Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large 
# amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of 
# the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves 
# regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech 
# geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, 
# but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from 
# accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to 
# perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available
# from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight 
# Lifting Exercise Dataset). 
# 
# Data 
# 
# The training data for this project are available here: 
#   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
# 
# The test data are available here: 
#   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv
# 
# The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. 
# If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have 
# been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment. 
# 
# What you should submit
# 
# The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the 
# "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. 
# You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, 
# what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You 
# will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. 


#SOLUTION:

#load train data
train <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coursera/machine learning/ML project/pml-training.csv")
test<- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coursera/machine learning/ML project/pml-testing.csv")

#create training and test set from train data set 
library(caret)

set.seed(456)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(train$classe, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
training <- train[inTrain, ]
testing <- train[-inTrain, ]



#selecting the right predictors
# remove predictors which have a near zero variance
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[, -nzv]

#remove predictors with more than 60% NA values
NAlength <- sapply(training, function(x) {
  sum(!(is.na(x) | x == ""))
})
rmNApred <- which(NAlength < 0.6 * length(training$classe))
training <- training[, -rmNApred]


#remove descriptive predictors
rmdesc <- c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window", "num_window")
rmdesc<- match(rmdesc,colnames(training))
rmdesc<-rmdesc[!is.na(rmdesc)]
training <- training[, -rmdesc]


# model using Randomforests
library(randomForest)
modFit <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = training, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 10)


# model validation
predtesting<-predict(modFit,testing)
confusionMatrix(predtesting, testing$classe)
